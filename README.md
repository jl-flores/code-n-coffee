# code-n-coffee
Code and Coffee is casual venue for EBOH students to share code and get to know each other! 

Code and Coffee is a 15-30 minute bi-weekly session where a student shares some code that they have found particularly useful. Think of it as "show and tell", but instead of a sad caterpillar on a twig in a jar, it's a tantalizing function that you didn't even know existed. It's quick, it's casual, and you might learn some useful code in the time it took to grab a coffee! 

This initiative is currently being organized by Marshall Lloyd (epi PhD student) and Chinchin Wang (epi PhD student).
